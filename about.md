### TL;DR
I enjoy coding. I’m focusing on Android development now, and I love open source, agile development, and new technologies which I'm definitely willing to try out. I am on my way to become a technological master.

### Summary

I’m Piasy (建林，许). I receive my Bachelor degree on Computer Science in Tsinghua University. During my college time, I did internship in Baidu, Inc. and YOUNG team, maintaining C++ platform and develop Android client respectively. I appreciate technology, love technology, and enjoy dealing real-life challenge, improving productivity, and making life more colorful, with technology. Now I’m focusing on Android development, but my sight will never be limited in it, instead I’ll be excited to know awesome technologies in every field. I do believe what one of my mentor in college said: We are not genius, but we could become more excellent than most of others with harder working. And I am now on my way to become a technological master. My dev blog is [http://blog.piasy.com/](http://blog.piasy.com/).

### What I want to do

I’ve been working on Android development for almost 2 years, but my knowledge about Android system is not solid, so I’ll focus on Android platform in next 1~2 years in the future. At the same time, I’ll be notified with new technologies in other fields. I plan to expand my skill stack, follow the tech trending, and work hard to become a technological master, expert.
