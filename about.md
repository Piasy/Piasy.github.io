[中文版]({{ site.baseurl }}/about-zh), [full resume](http://resume.piasy.com/dist/piasy_resume_en.html)

### TL;DR
I enjoy coding. I’m focusing on Android development now, and I love open source, agile development, and new technologies which I'm definitely willing to try out. I am on my way to become an expert.

### Summary

I’m Piasy (建林，许). I receive my Bachelor degree on Computer Science in Tsinghua University at 2015. Now I'm leading the Android team at YOLO, a mobile live streaming App. I appreciate technology, and enjoy dealing real-life challenge with technology. Now I’m focusing on Android application development, but my sight will never be limited in it. I think solving valuable problems with team members, efficiently and reliably, is the most important thing when building a product. To achieve this, critical thinking, ability to learn new things, and collaborating with others are key points. My dev blog is [http://blog.piasy.com/](http://blog.piasy.com/), and my GitHub profile is [https://github.com/Piasy/](https://github.com/Piasy/).

### What I want to do

I’ve been working on Android development for almost 2 years, but my knowledge about Android system is not solid, so I’ll focus on Android platform in next 1~2 years in the future. At the same time, I’ll be notified with new technologies in other fields. I plan to expand my skill stack, follow the tech trending, and work hard to become a technological master, expert.
